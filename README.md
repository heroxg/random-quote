# App Name: Random Quotes

The app generates random quotes and their author. To view more quotes click on the "Get Quotes" button.
Click to view the Live [demo](https://getdailyquote.netlify.app/).


# Tech Stack 

The technologies used are React, Typescript, HTML and CSS. The quotes are being displayed using Axios. 

Axios is a promised-based HTTP Client for the browser and Nodejs. it can be used to make http request from 
nodejs. you can read more [here](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# API Setup

When you have cloned the project and ran it locally, you may not be able to view the random quotes unless you do the following:

## Steps:
1. Create an account on [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com)
2. Search for random quotes
3. In the code snippets section select (Nodejs)Axios
4. Copy the snippets and paste into your code 

### Note:

change the 'X-RapidAPI-Key' to that of yours and you should be able to make a get request to the API endpoint.
